# Energy Forecasting and Analysis in Spain (Power BI + Python)

This project analyzes and forecasts electrical energy demand, generation, and pricing trends in Spain using real-world hourly data (2015–2018). It combines:

- 📊 Power BI: for interactive dashboards and visualization
- 🐍 Python: for data preprocessing, time series forecasting (ARIMA, Holt-Winters)
- 🌤️ Weather data: used as features in the analysis and modeling

## Dataset
[Kaggle: Hourly energy demand, generation and weather in Spain](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather)

Includes:
- `energy_dataset.csv`: hourly demand, generation by source, and pricing
- `weather_features.csv`: hourly weather data from multiple cities
